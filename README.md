## n2qr - convert strings into qr codes, printed to the terminal.

Currently, this simply converts an argument string into a qr code and prints it to a terminal output. In the future, I plan for this to act as a library so I can easily incorporate text-based qr codes into my terminal applications.

`usage: n2qr <string>`
